Design resource repository for IROS2025 submission

File "valve_embedded_fixture_bottom_mk4.STL" and "valve_embedded_fixture_cap_mk4.STL" is the 3D model for the valve adapter.

File "Schematic_integrated_mckibben_zigzag_2024-07-26.pdf" is the circuit schematic for the control board inside the actuator.

File "PCB_PCB_multi_layer_2024-07-26.json" is the PCB design file. It can be opened with EasyEDA by JLCPCB. The PCB boards are also ordered from JLCPCB.

"ctrl_ui.py" is a python serial monitor based on pygame. We developed it for communication with the actuator.
The folder "data" is copied from one of the pygame_gui example. It contains fonts and design elements for the gui application.
